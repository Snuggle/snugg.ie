# 👋 I'm new here, what's going on?

Oh, hello! This is just the source-code for my personal website. It might be interesting, who knows!

# 🏗 What is this based upon?
This is a fork of the lovely Jekyll template [moodule/jekyll-theme-stellar](https://github.com/apehex/jekyll-theme-stellar). This is a HTML5 template that I absolutely love. This has been pretty heavily edited throughout to make it my own so I'd recommend you'd start from scratch with the original!
