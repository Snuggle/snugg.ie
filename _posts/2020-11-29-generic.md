## About 'n' Stuff

Hello! Let me tell you the tale of my dabblings with home servers or ['Homelab'](https://reddit.com/r/homelab) equipment.

So as a tech nerd, I loved hosting little services and such to make my life easier. From things like [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/), as a cloud storage replacement for something like [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/), to a personal VPN with [Wireguard](https://wireguard.com/), my requirements ended up expanding to the point where I was spending up to £35/month on a rented VPS.

This couldn't continue! Things were getting too expensive and I didn't like keeping my [NAS](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage) storage in the cloud — it was slow.
Enter... Hug Server.
